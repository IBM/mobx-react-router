# react-router-mobx
Keep your MobX state in sync with react-router

Very much inspired by (and copied from) [react-router-redux](https://github.com/reactjs/react-router-redux/tree/master/test).

This is for use with **react-router v3** *(currently in beta)*.

For use with **react-router v4** a `v4` version will be on the way soon; the `v3` version is the priority at the moment.
